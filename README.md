# HATE-SPEECH-DETECTION-USING-TWITTER-DATASET

**DESCRIPTTION:**
Hate speech detection using a Twitter dataset involves the identification and classification of tweets containing harmful, offensive, or discriminatory language. This is achieved through the application of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and innovative algorithms like fuzzy logic to analyze the content of tweets.

**HOW TO USE**
1. **Upload Data:**
2.      Import a Twitter dataset in `.csv` or `.json` format or connect to the Twitter API for live data.  
3. **Select Model:**
4.     Choose a machine learning or deep learning model for tweet classification.  
5. **Run Analysis:**
6.     Classify tweets as **Hate Speech**, **Offensive**, or **Neutral** using the tool.  
7. **View Results:**
8.     Access results via dashboards, charts, or tables for clear insights.  
9. **Export Data:**
10.        Save results in `.csv` or `.json` or integrate with content moderation systems.

   Social media platforms like Twitter often host harmful language that can incite violence or propagate discrimination. Detecting hate speech is a critical step toward maintaining online civility and safeguarding users. This project uses Twitter datasets containing labeled examples of hate speech, offensive speech, and neutral content to build a model capable of identifying hate speech accurately.
